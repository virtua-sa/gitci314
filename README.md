# Gitci314 - Gitlab CI for Raspberry Pi 3+

This project is proudly offered to you by Virtua SA.

## Install

1. [Get a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) (but it should works with RPi 2B (64b) and 3B too)
2. [Flash](https://etcher.io/) a [Raspbian image](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest) on it
3. `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virtua-sa/gitci314/master/install | bash`

It takes up to 30 minutes to run Gitlab for the first time.
Also, first access to Gitlab may be very slow but it improves greatly after few requets.

*Warning: SSH port of your Raspberry Pi will be changed from 22 to 2022 to allow Git over SSH.*

## Recommendations

* Because Gitlab consumes a lot of RAM, this setup uses a 4GiB swap file
  * In aim to increase the lifespan of your Raspberry Pi SD card, you should move this file to an USB drive with :
    `SWAPFILE=/dev/sdaX ./install`
* If you have an intensive use of Gitlab CI runners, you should move the Gitlab Multi Runner image to another Raspberry Pi
* In aim to have more space for your Git projects, move the shared folders to an external USB drive (see `docker-compose.yml` file)
* Of course, this setup *MUST NOT* be used for production purpose. It is mainly a proof of concept and should be used as is.
